 * (transform, instance-level paint, instance-level name).
 *
 * Found and fixed via diffing a real, large file (jeff.skp: 2713
 * definitions, 113643 faces) against its own regenerated output - an
 * earlier prototype this module replaced silently dropped instance-level
 * paint (95% of that file's instances) and every instance's own name
 * entirely, and never emitted textured materials at all.
 *
 * Only reproduces geometry reachable by walking faces (`Definition.faces`)
 * - a real file's standalone/construction edges and curves that don't
 * bound any face are NOT reproduced (found via the same real-fixture
 * diffing: one real file's "shelf2B" definition turned out to be 4088 of
 * its 5196 edges loose reference geometry, none of it visible surface
 * area). This does not affect materials, textures, instance paint, or any
 * face/surface geometry - only invisible construction/reference lines.
 *
 * Also not yet handled (matching this project's established disclosure
 * pattern for known gaps): colorized material tint, per-face
 * hidden/soft/smooth edge flags, section planes, text/dimension entities.
 * A model using any of these round-trips its geometry/materials/instances
 * correctly; those specific facts are silently dropped.
 *
 * A face a few millionths of an inch off its own fitted plane (common in
 * real files - floating-point noise, not a modeling error) is
 * auto-triangulated rather than rejected, mirroring real SketchUp's own
 * tolerance - matches the input's face count unless triangulation was
 * actually needed, in which case one input face becomes 2+ (visually
 * identical, more triangles internally).
 *
 * Every textured face is emitted with explicit `frontUv`/`backUv` (3 real
 * vertices + their actual rendered UV, via `computeFaceUv`/`faceUvBasis` -
 * the same formula the reader/renderer use), never left to the writer's
 * default projection - this reproduces the source file's rendering exactly
 * regardless of whether it originally used a pin or the default
 * projection, and sidesteps `addTextureMaterial`'s default applied-height
 * sentinel corrupting the result (see `addTextureMaterial`'s own note in
 * create.ts). A 4-pin *projective* (non-affine) source mapping can't be
 * reproduced exactly this way - front_uv is an affine (3-point) fit, the
 * same limitation the writer itself already has.
